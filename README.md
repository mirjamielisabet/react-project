## To Do App

User can add, edit, rearrange, delete and mark tasks done. 
In addition to the description, the tasks can have a tag and a due date.

The app is deployed on [Render](https://react-to-do-app.onrender.com/)

## Motivation

This app has been created as a part of the Frontend development course in TAMK (Tampere University of Applied Sciences).

The App was created and returned for the course in 12/2021 and it was later (2/2022) uploaded to Github with minor edits.
